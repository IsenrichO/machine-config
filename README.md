# Machine Configuration

[machine-config](https://github.com/IsenrichO/machine-config) is a collection of static assets, configuration files (_.*rc_) and settings/user preference resources that I use to get a new machine back up and running with the dev environment I want and the time wasted I don't. It ensures I have a persisted home for some of the most important "meta-files" used to make my Mac... my Mac. In particular, it sets me back up with my preferred Sublime editor and Terminal environments without the massive workflow interruptions that often accompany getting started on a new machine.

I've spent embarassingly much time messing with Sublime's user settings file [Ref. _User/Preferences.sublime-settings_], but have finally got something I think I can tolerate for a while. Before just transposing this settings object to another Sublime dist, remember that a bevy of packages and plugins must first be installed for many of those settings fields to have recongizeable effects.

For a list of my must-have Sublime Text integrations (_read:_ Package Control plugins), see the [Wiki](https://github.com/IsenrichO/machine-config/wiki/Sublime-Text-Setup).

My Terminal profile is derived from [Agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme)'s awesome theme built for the Zsh shell.
